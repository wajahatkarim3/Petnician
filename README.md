## :scroll: Description
A minimalist pet adoption app inspired by [designs by Pixelz Studio](https://dribbble.com/shots/7337529-Pet-Sharing-App) to demonstrate Jetpack Compose UI for submission in #AndroidDevChallenge Week 1.


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
I managed to create a beautiful Bottom Bar menu with interesting animations with the use of `AnimatedVisibility`.
